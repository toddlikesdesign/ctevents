<p>Still feeling the love after Friday night's farewell event for Mayor Sam Adams, which was also a benefit for RACC (Regional Arts and Culture Council)   More than 800 guests came to celebrate the role that art plays in our community and honor the Mayor for his support of the arts during his time in office.</p>
<p>A star-studded cast saluted Sam in an incredible tribute show, written and produced by Kate Sokoloff and Phil Incorvia, and then the party just took off from there!  Multi-cultural performances by various RACC artists, dancing to DJ Prashant (along with the 503 Portland electric slide group,  Bollywood and salsa dancing) kept the party hopping.  Work for Art had an "Art Apothecary", Right Brain Initiative engaged people with an Animation Station, and local mural artist Chris Haberman  involved party-goers with a 40' mural to be raffled off next week.</p>
<p>My co-producer, Bob Gandolfi, and I truly enjoyed working with the arts community and RACC on this project, because we both believe so strongly in the arts and how important they are to a vibrant community like Portland!</p>
