title: Catch The Orange
---
<p>At more than 1,700 feet in length, the Tilikum Crossing, Bridge of the People, is the only bridge of its kind in the U.S. This new Portland bridge will carry MAX trains, buses, streetcars, cyclists and pedestrians starting in September 2015 with the opening of the MAX Orange Line. The grand opening of this bridge and new TriMet line means it's time to Catch the Orange!</p>

<p>I'm excited to help celebrate the Grand Opening of the bridge and Orange Line on September 12th! 
<br><br>
For the big day all rides on MAX, TriMet buses, Portland Streetcar and the Aerial Tam will be free, bringing riders and families from all over the Portland Metro area to a day of adventure and fun. From live performances, interactive art projects, face painting, food + beverages, and music, we have so many exciting activities and dynamic entertainers lined up for each stop!
