title: In the Garden of Artistic Delights
---
<p>On Saturday, August 1, we produced a very special event to benefit the Regional Arts & Culture Council (RACC)’s grantmaking program for individual artists. This non profit fundraiser, called “In the Garden of Artistic Delights,” celebrated RACC’s 20th anniversary as well as the splendor of Portland's local artists with delicous food, tantalizing beverages, artistic discoveries sprinkled throughout the magical garden, a live auction and raffle.</p>

“In the Garden of Artistic Delights”, RACC's first-ever fundraising event for individual artsits, raised a fantastic sum of $36,000 and a full 100% of the proceeds will be awarded as grants to individual artists this fall and winter. These funds will help RACC support more extraordinary and innovative artists throughout the Portland metro area!

We had so much fun at this event! We are excited about the outcome and the future artists the RACC can support!
