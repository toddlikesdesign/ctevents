<p>More than 11,000 craft brewers landed in Portland for the annual Craft Brewing Convention, and we were thrilled to be a part of the action.  Fun flowed as much as the beer under our   "Beer City Big Top" that we produced for GEAâ€”manufacturers of the Westfalia Beer Separator.</p><span class="image right"><img src="/images/9269475.jpg"></span>
<p>With the presence of hundreds of breweries there was no shortage of libations and friendly beer banter. Devil's Food Catering brought in a two hundred pound tuna to add the finishing touch to the sushi bar, while Vagabond Opera serenaded the beer enthusiasts with their quirky circus themed music.</p>
<p>Guests enjoyed casino games downstairs, while others visited the scotch and cigar tent. The sunny and seventy degree weather was truly the icing on a circus- themed cake.</p>
<p>Cheers to an awesome event and to many more in the future!</p>
