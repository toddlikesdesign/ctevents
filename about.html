<h3>Cindy Thompson | Portland, OR Event Planner</h3>
<p>
Cindy Thompson performs magic. Literally. Just ask her nephew. Cindy’s triumphant magic show and birthday party-throwing skills set the benchmark for quality at the Pelton household that stand to this day.  By the way, she was 10 at the time. Yep, that’s her on the left, rocking the pigtails. 
</p>
<p>
Cindy’s next trick was to create magic for KGW Radio--Portland, Oregon's legendary station.  During her tenure, she produced the city's largest celebration, Neighborfair, for five years. 
</p>
<p>
In 1987, Cindy took her show on the road to form Celebrations, one of Portland’s first special events planning firms. Though the pigtails are gone, she continues to dazzles corporate, civic and non-profit clients with her unique brand of hi>h-touch, one-of–a kind, inspired happenings and special events.
